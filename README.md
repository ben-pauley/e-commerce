# E-Commerce Back End

## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my completed E-Commerce Tracker Back End in the form of an Express.js API, which was completed using Node.js, along with the sequelize package to connect to a MySQL database. The purpose of this application is to allow a user to connect to a MySQL database via an API using CRUD operations by simply using different API routes.

## Installation

To install this project, you may either clone this repository to a local directory, or fork the repository to your own GitHub. After ensuring your MySQL server is running, you must then open the schema.sql file, copy the contents of this file into MySQL Workbench (or an SQL visual database design tool of your choice) and run the code to create the database. Next, open .env.EXAMPLE, and fill in your MySQL server credentials. Then rename the file to just .env. After having installed Node.js, you must then install all the required node modules using `npm install` in the command line. Then, after running `npm run seed` to insert starting data into the database, you will be able to start the server by running `npm start`. [This video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PgjclEyUYKJLhcuAPTjXg2Cka3T-w3Ke/view) demonstrates exactly how to do all of this.

## Usage

To test the server is functioning correctly and make API calls, you may use an API client of your choice. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16mB-O98EJ2brd5vIkduscVi-hQzPzSqf/view) is a video demonstrating the use of the API in Insomnia.

## Software Used

The development of this project was completed using Visual Studio Code, MySQL Workbench, Node.js, and sequelize, express and dotenv packages, as well as the command line.

## Conclusion

Overall, I found this application fairly straightforward to develop, especially in comparison with previous tasks. I'm starting to really enjoy back end development and can't wait for the next challenge.
